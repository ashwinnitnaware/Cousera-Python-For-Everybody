10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.
From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008
Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.
